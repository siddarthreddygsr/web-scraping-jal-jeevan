# Data Scraping Jal Jeevan project

**NOTE: `main-parallel.py` isn't functioning as expected currently and needs some work to be done. The dataframe needs to be handles properly among threads to be precise.**

To run first copy the templates to the mentioned naming format by doing
```bash
cp templates/output-template.csv output.csv
cp templates/block-template.csv block.csv
```
**DO NOT** use these if you are starting the script after running midway because the script stopped for some reason.

To run:
```bash
python3 main.py 
```
